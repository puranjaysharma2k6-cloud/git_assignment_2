# GitHub Features Overview

This document describes key features provided by GitHub for software development and collaboration.

---

## 1. Repositories

Repositories are storage spaces for projects. They contain source code, commit history, branches, and documentation. Repositories can be public or private and allow collaboration among multiple developers.

---

## 2. Branching and Merging

GitHub supports creating branches to work on features independently without affecting the main codebase. After development, branches can be merged back using pull requests.

---

## 3. Pull Requests (PRs)

Pull requests allow developers to propose changes, review code, discuss improvements, and merge updates safely. PRs provide diff views, comments, and approval workflows.

---

## 4. Issues Tracking

Issues help track bugs, feature requests, and tasks. They can be assigned, labeled, prioritized, and linked to pull requests for better project management.

---

## 5. GitHub Actions (CI/CD)

GitHub Actions automates workflows such as building, testing, and deploying applications. Workflows run automatically on events like push, pull request, or release.

---

## 6. Projects (Kanban Boards)

Projects provide task boards similar to Kanban. Developers can organize issues and pull requests into columns like To Do, In Progress, and Done.

---

## 7. Releases and Versioning

GitHub allows creating releases linked to tags. Releases can include compiled binaries, changelogs, and documentation for distribution.

---

## 8. Wiki and Documentation

Each repository can include a wiki for detailed documentation. README files and markdown support make it easy to maintain project guides.

---

## 9. Forking

Forking lets users copy a repository to their own account to experiment or contribute without affecting the original project.

---

## 10. Collaboration and Permissions

GitHub supports team collaboration with role-based access control, allowing maintainers to manage contributors securely.
